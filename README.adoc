= NoIP hosts auto renew

This little script connects to NoIP and updates your free hosts automatically.
No more email from NoIP telling you that your host are going to be removed !

== Requirements
To use this script, you have to install NodeJS and CasperJS.
The command `casperjs` must be system-wide.
(If you want to change that, you'll have to edit noip_auto_renew.sh)

== Setup
Before using the script, you have to rename or copy config.sample.js to config.js, and fill the username and password fields with your NoIP credentials.

== Usage
`$ /path/to/the/script/noip_auto_renew.sh`

== Cron
The script can be runned manually, but you will probably want to create a CRON for it.
